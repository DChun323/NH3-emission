# NH3-emission

**NH3-emission** is a Github repository that composes of results, data, code, PPT, and some references. It can be found at Github: [https://github.com/bnulzq/NH3-emission.git](https://github.com/bnulzq/NH3-emission.git) and Zenodo: [https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6965444](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6965444).

The work of *Estimating global ammonia (NH3) emissions based on IASI observations from 2008 to 2018* is published on ACP, and this project is ongoing to improve our NH3 emission estimates. The work progress is presented in the folder [*PPT*](#ppt), the correspond scripts are in the folder [*Code*](#code), some references are in the folder [*Ref*](#ref) and part of the data are in the folder [*Data*](#data). Most of work is done when I visited the Atmospheric Environmental Research Lab of the Westlake University, as I leaved and published our paper, I sorted out some relevant items and wrote this **README** document.

To learn more about my work, check out the [**Estimating global ammonia (NH3) emissions based on IASI observations from 2008 to 2018**](

## Results

### Data Description

The dataset ia produced based on the Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer (IASI) observations in Luo et al.,(2022), by updating the prior ammonia (NH3) emission fluxes with the ratio between biases in simulated NH3 concentrations and effective NH3 lifetimes against the loss of the NHx family (NHx $\equiv$ NH3 + $NH_4^+$). We then include sulfur dioxide (SO2) column to correct the NH3 emission trends over India and China, where SO2 emissions have changed rapidly in recent years. Finally, we quantify the uncertainty of NH3 emission by a series of perturbation and sensitivity experiments. The GEOS-Chem simulation driven by top-down estimates has lower bias with the IASI observations than prior emissions, demonstrating the consistency of our estimates with observations.

### Metadata

Spatial resolution: $4^\circ \times5^\circ$

Spatial range: 

* Latitude: $70^\circ S -- 70^\circ N$
* Longitude: $-180^\circ -- \ 180^\circ$
  
Temporal resolution: monthly

Layers:

* TDE: NH3 top-down emission (TDE) estimate
* BUE: NH3 bottom-up emission (BUE) inventory
* NH3_obs: observed NH3 column density
* NH3_mod: simulated NH3 column density
* NH3_lifetime: NH3 lifetime

Fill value: NaN

A mask is applied to non-land area, i.e., the grids that fraction of land < 0.2.

### Known Caveat

Our dataset excludes grid cells with the number of successful retrievals less than 800 in a month, and grids where transport dominates over local prior emissions or depositions in the monthly NHx budget. Caution is needed when analyzing the long-term average/trend of NH3 emission with the missing values. Proper gap-filling procedure is recommended before any long-term analysis.

Note that NH3 emission is produced based on our best knowledge. We welcome users's test, diagnoses, and feedback for this dataset so that we can keep improving it.

### Next steps

See the [**PPT**](#ppt) files, all figures, accomplishment, data, and future plan in them.

Feel free to contact and discuss with me if what you want is not already there. If you would prefer a less formal approach to talk to me, add the Wechat: *bnulzq*.

It also takes a fair bit of work to study further with the NH3 emission, including more satellite for SO2 concentration and explore if the NH3 emission could be improved especially over important source regions (e.g., China, India etc.).
