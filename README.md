# NH3-emission

**NH3-emission** is a Github repository that composes of results, data, code, PPT, and some references. It can be found at [https://github.com/bnulzq/NH3-emission.git](https://github.com/bnulzq/NH3-emission.git; https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6965444) 

The work of *Estimating global ammonia (NH3) emissions based on IASI observations from 2008 to 2018* is published on ACP, and this project is ongoing to improve our NH3 emission estimates. The work progress is presented in the folder [*PPT*](#ppt), the correspond scripts are in the folder [*Code*](#code), some references are in the folder [*Ref*](#ref) and part of the data are in the folder [*Data*](#data). Most of work is done when I visited the Atmospheric Environmental Research Lab of the Westlake University, as I leaved and published our paper, I sorted out some relevant items and wrote this **README** document.
